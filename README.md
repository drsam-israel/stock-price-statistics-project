# stock-price-statistics-project

## Introduction:

Thrilled to share a major milestone in my data analytics journey! 

I just completed an in-depth Stock Price Statistical Analysis Project using Advanced Excel, and it has been nothing short of enthralling!

Delving deep into the historical performance of Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) from 2018 to 2023 revealed compelling insights into market trends, price movements, and volatility patterns.

Leveraging Excel's powerful tools for data analysis—from pivot tables and statistical functions to advanced charting and regression analysis—I was able to uncover trends and relationships that offered a clearer picture of how these major market players have evolved over the years.
